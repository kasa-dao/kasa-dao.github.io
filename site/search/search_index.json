What is The Kasa Project? TL;DR: A new project that connects real-world assets with defi. Specifically, we are acquiring real-estate globally and securing it on the Solana blockchain - and rewarding KASA token holders - you can join us here! The native token is KASA and you can get some by bonding your SOL or USDC on our app . KASA tokens give you ownership of real-estate, land and properties globally. KASA holders benefit from property value appreciation and also earn returns from the portfolio of real-estate and other defi holdings. We are talking real world properties here - not virtual land!

Why Real Estate? Globally, it is estimated the total value of real-estate is greater than USD $320 Trillion (that's a lot of zeros!) In comparison, this dwarfs every other market: Real-estate: ~$326.5T Debt Securities: ~$123.5T Equities: ~$109.2T Global GDP: ~$84.8T Gold: ~$12.1T Crypto: ~$2.0T The ownership of this large amount of capital rests with the few. It is primarily banks, large corporations and the \"elite\" that own most of this, and the rest of us can't get our grubby little hands on it incase we get some dirt on it! We feel that it is time to change this, and what better way to than to pull real-estate into crypto. Not the other way around - we don't want to try and bend this leading-edge technology to fit in with archaic old systems and the old dinosaurs ways. We want to make the world move with us. Why Solana? Solana is fast, scalable and has very low transaction fees. It is a rapidly growing blockchain technology and community, and as of writing, has around $30B market cap.","title":"Why"},{"location":"why/#why","text":"","title":"Why?"},{"location":"why/#why-real-estate","text":"Globally, it is estimated the total value of real-estate is greater than USD $320 Trillion (that's a lot of zeros!)
