# Welcome to The Kasa Project

Our website is live at [kasa.finance][kasa]!

## What is The Kasa Project?

> TL;DR: A new project that connects real-world assets with defi. 
> Specifically, we are acquiring real-estate globally and securing it on the Solana blockchain - and rewarding KASA token holders - you can join us [here!][kasa]

The native token is KASA and you can get some by bonding your SOL or USDC on our [app][app].

_KASA_ tokens give you ownership of real-estate, land and properties globally. KASA holders benefit from property value appreciation and also earn returns from the portfolio of real-estate and other defi holdings. We are talking real world properties here - not virtual land!


Feel free to browse through our documentation and learn about our project, or head on over to our [app][app] to join us today!
